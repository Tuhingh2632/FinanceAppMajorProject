      <h1>BOND INVESTMENT</h1>
      <p>
        Government bond in India is essentially a contract between the issuer
        and the investor, wherein the issuer guarantees interest earnings on the
        face value of bonds held by investors along with repayment of the
        principal value on a stipulated date.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Government Bonds India</strong>, fall under the broad category
        of government securities (G-Sec) and are primarily long term investment
        tools issued for periods ranging from 5 to 40 years. It can be issued by
        both Central and State governments of India. Government bonds issued by
        State Governments are also called State Development Loans (SDLs).
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, most G-Secs were issued for the purpose of large investors,
        such as companies and commercial banks. However, eventually, GOI made
        government securities available to smaller investors such as individual
        investors, co-operative banks, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are multiple variants of bonds issued by GOI and State Governments
        which cater to the various investment objectives of investors. The&nbsp;
        <strong>Government Bond interest rates,</strong> also called a coupon,
        can either be fixed or floating and disbursed on a semi-annual basis. In
        most cases, GOI issues bonds at a fixed coupon rate in the market.

        The multiple variants of&nbsp;<strong>Government bonds</strong>&nbsp;are
        discussed below &ndash;

      <h2>
        <strong>Fixed-rate bonds</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Government bonds of this nature come with a fixed rate of interest which
        remains constant throughout the tenure of investment irrespective of
        fluctuating market rates.
      </p>
      <p>
        The coupon on a Government Bond is mentioned in the nomenclature. For
        instance, 7% GOI 2021 means the following

            <td>2021</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <h2>
        <strong>Floating Rate Bonds (FRBs)</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        As the name suggests, FRBs are subject to periodic changes in rate of
        returns. The change in rates is undertaken at intervals which are
        declared beforehand during the issuance of such bonds. For instance, an
        FRB could have a pre-announced interval of 6 months; which means
        interest rates on it would be re-set every six months throughout the
        tenure.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is another variant to FRBs, wherein the rate of interest rate is
        bifurcated into two components: a base rate and a fixed spread. This
        spread is decided through auction and remains constant throughout the
        maturity tenure.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <strong>Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Central Government issues sovereign Gold Bonds, wherein entities can
        invest in gold for an extended period through such bonds, without the
        burden of investing in physical gold. The interest earned on such bonds
        is exempted from tax.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prices of such bonds are linked with gold&rsquo;s prices. The nominal
        value of SGBs is reached by calculating the simple average of closing
        prices of 99.99% purity gold, three days preceding such bonds&rsquo;
        issuance. SGBs are also denominated in terms of one gram of gold.
      </p>
      <p>
        As per RBI regulations, there are individual ceilings concerning SGB
        possession for different entities. Individuals and Hindu Undivided
        Families can only hold up to 4 kg of Sovereign Gold Bonds in a financial
        year. Trusts and other relevant entities can hold up to 20 kg if SGBs
        during a similar time frame. Interest at 2.50% is disbursed periodically
        on such SGBs and has a fixed maturity period of 8 years unless stated
        otherwise. Also, no tax is levied on interest earnings through such
        SGBs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Investors seeking liquidity from such bonds shall need to wait for the
        first five years to redeem them. However, redemption shall only take
        effect on the date of subsequent interest disbursal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assuming that Mr A invested in an SGB on 1st April 2014, interest
        disbursals are set on 1st May 2014 and every six months from thereon. In
        case he decides to withdraw it on 1st June 2019, he shall need to wait
        till 1st November 2019(interest disbursal date) to receive the
        redemption amount.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <strong>Inflation-Indexed Bonds</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        It is a unique financial instrument, wherein the principal, as well as
        the interest earned on such bond, is accorded with inflation. Mainly
        issued for retail investors, these bonds are indexed as per the Consumer
        Price Index (CPI) or Wholesale Price Index (WPI). Such IIBs ensure real
        returns accrued with such investments remain constant, thereby allowing
        investors to safeguard their portfolio against inflation rates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another variant of such inflation-adjusted securities is Capital Indexed
        Bond. However, unlike IIBs, only the capital or principal proportion of
        balance is accorded with an inflation index.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <strong>7.75% GOI Savings Bond</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        This G-Sec was introduced as a replacement to the 8% Savings Bond in
        2018. As noted from its nomenclature, the interest rate of such bonds is
        set at 7.75%. As per RBI regulations, these bonds can only be held by
        &ndash;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An individual or individuals who are/are not NRI(s) in any capacity
        </li>
        <li>A minor with a legal guardian representative</li>
        <li>A Hindu Undivided Family</li>
      </ul>
      <p>

        1961 as per the investors&rsquo; applicable{" "}

        minimum amount at which these bonds are issued is Rs. 1000 and in
        multiples of Rs. 1000 thereof.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <strong>Bonds with Call or Put Option</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        The distinguishing feature of this type of bonds is the issuer enjoys
        the right to buy-back such bonds (call option) or the investor can
        exercise its right to sell (put option) them to such issuer. This
        transaction shall only take place on a date of interest disbursal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Participating entities, i.e. the government and investor can only
        exercise their rights after the lapse of 5 years from its issuance date.
        This type of bonds might come with either &ndash;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Call option only</li>
        <li>Put option only</li>
        <li>Both</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In any case, the government can buy back its bonds at face value.
        Similarly, investors can sell such bonds to the issuer at face value.
        This ensures the preservation of the corpus invested in case of any
        downturn of the <a href="https://groww.in/stocks">stock market</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <strong>Zero-Coupon Bonds</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        As the name suggests, Zero-Coupon Bonds do not earn any interest.
        Earnings from Zero-Coupon Bonds arise from the difference in issuance
        price (at a discount) and redemption value (at par). This type of bonds
        are not issued through auction but rather created from existing
        securities.

        Capital Indexed Bonds is also adjusted against inflation. This feature
        provides an edge to investors as they are less susceptible to be
        financially undermined as investing in such funds increase the real
        value of the deposited funds.
