      <h1>INVESTMENT IN FD</h1>
      <p>
        Fixed deposits have a fixed tenure, hence the name. Depending on a
        consumer&rsquo;s investment portfolio, the FD investment period can
        either be short-term or long-term. The interest rates on fixed deposits
        vary from one company or bank to another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fixed deposit investors need to remember, however, that they cannot
        withdraw money before maturity without financial repercussions. In
        emergencies, early withdrawal is possible after the payment of
        penalties.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Who Offers FD?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        As stated, fixed deposit investments are offered by banks, post-offices,
        and other non-banking financial companies. In India, investors have
        countless options to open fixed deposit accounts. However, they must
        compare the interest rates, the reputation of the company, and other
        factors before depositing their funds.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can approach any of the banks or NBFCs in the country to open
        a&nbsp;fixed deposit account. Individuals lacking bank accounts can also
        avail of fixed deposit investments through post office accounts.
      </p>
      <h1>Types of FDs Available</h1>
      <p>
        There are several fixed deposit types that investors need to know about
        before investing. Without such knowledge, you may end up picking up
        plans not suitable to your investment objectives. Listed below are some
        of the common options open to prospective investors.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Corporate fixed deposits</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are fixed deposit schemes that are held by companies, other than
        banks. Also known as company FDs, investing in such instruments, may, in
        some cases, lead to higher returns.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Standard fixed deposits</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Standard plans are basic investment schemes where you invest a fixed
        amount with a financial institution. After the fixed maturity period
        expires, you are eligible to receive the principal amount, along with
        the interest earnings from the scheme.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Senior citizen fixed deposit</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Individuals aged over 60 years are also eligible to invest in fixed
        deposit instruments. However, most plans geared to this age group offer
        flexible tenure options. Additionally, senior citizen investors are
        eligible for higher interest rates on their investments compared to the
        standard schemes.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Tax-saving fixed deposit</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If the primary goal of an investment is to save taxes, investors can
        take advantage of tax-saving FDs. However, the maximum deposit for such
        plans is limited to Rs. 1.5 Lakh per year. The lock-in period for this
        type of FD is 5 years.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Cumulative fixed deposit</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In these fixed deposit schemes, the interest is compounded quarterly,
        half-yearly, or yearly. However, the total interest earnings are paid at
        the time of maturity. Opting for this kind of FD allows you to build
        your corpus considerably.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Non-cumulative fixed deposit</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Interest earnings on fixed deposits are paid out monthly, quarterly, or
        half-yearly. This option is best for investors looking for a regular
        source of income. Hence, pensioners benefit prominently from such plans.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Flexi fixed deposit plans</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In this case, the deposit moves between a savings account and an&nbsp;FD
        account. Therefore, to initiate an investment using Flexi FDs, investors
        need to connect the fixed deposit account with their savings account.
        Investors can enjoy high-interest rates on their deposits along with
        liquidity with this category of FD plans.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>NRO fixed deposit account</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Non-resident Indians can deposit their earnings generated from India in
        an NRO FD account. The interest earned from these FD accounts can be
        repatriated entirely by NRO account holders, and the principal amount
        can only be repatriated up to a certain limit.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>NRE fixed deposit account</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        NRIs can remit their income generated abroad and invest in an NRE fixed
        deposit account. Both the interest and principal are repatriable in this
        case.
      </p>
      <h1>
        <strong>What are the Prevailing FD Rates?</strong>
      </h1>
      <p>
        There is no fixed rate on FD investments. The rate of return for an
        investor greatly depends on the bank or NBFC offering the investment
        option. Each bank provides different interest rates on deposits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the return rate also depends on the age of the investor.
        Senior citizen investors can expect higher returns when compared to
        individuals below 60 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the interest rates vary based on several variables such as FD
        tenure, the financial institution offering it, and the type of FD
        account or plan, investors can always expect better returns from their
        FDs than they can from their savings accounts.

      <h2>
        <strong>What is the Lock-in Period for Fixed Deposit?</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Lock-in period for a fixed deposit is also referred to as the maturity
        period. During this time, investors cannot withdraw their deposits
        without financial repercussions. For tax-saving FDs, withdrawing the sum
        before the lock-in period ends is strictly prohibited.
      </p>
      <p>
        For other kinds of FDs, premature withdrawal is possible but leads to
        penalties. The exact penalty terms may differ from one investment plan
        to another.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is always desirable, however, to keep deposits intact until maturity.
        When the term ends, investors receive substantial returns. Withdrawing
        early will lead to loss of interest earnings from the FD.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <strong>Why Should Investors Consider FD for Their Portfolio</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Investors may be exposed to risks when they invest in market-linked
        instruments to earn higher returns. Hence, to ensure balanced financial
        growth, investors need to seek safer investment options as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fixed deposits are safe and lead to guaranteed returns, as opposed to
        riskier instruments. Therefore, even when an investor loses money on
        other investment instruments, they can recover a portion of their losses
        from the FD investments.
      </p>
      <h1>
        <strong>Advantages of FD</strong>
      </h1>
      <p>
        FD investors can look forward to the following benefits from their
        investments.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Assured returns &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>Unlike most other
          investment schemes, FDs offer guaranteed returns on the deposited sum.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Offers great flexibility &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;best
          FD&nbsp;plans offer flexibility when it comes to the tenure of the
          plan. Depending on investor goals, they can either open short-term FD
          accounts or long-term FD accounts. For reference, most financial
          institutions offer maturity tenures ranging from 7 days to 10 years.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>High capital appreciation &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>Cumulative
          fixed deposit plans compound interest monthly or quarterly or
          half-yearly. Hence, the deposit amount is substantially appreciated by
          the end of tenure.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>An additional source of income &ndash; </strong>The investor
          can select the frequency of interest payout for non-cumulative fixed
          deposit plans. Therefore, they can act as an added source of income.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>
        <strong>Limitations of FD</strong>
      </h1>
      <p>
        While&nbsp;bank fixed deposits&nbsp;are greatly beneficial for many,
        they suffer from certain disadvantages as well. Here are some
        limitations for such instruments.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Interest rates remain fixed &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>Fixed
          deposit interest rates do not grow over time or comply with inflation.
          Therefore, they are not the appropriate choice for investment if an
          individual is trying to beat inflation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Deposit lock-in</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&ndash;&nbsp;</strong>A
          lump sum amount is locked-in for a specific period. You cannot use
          this money in case of emergencies if you want to ensure proper returns
          from the investment. Early withdrawals lead to penalties and
          additional charges.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Early withdrawal charges &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;If an investor
          decides to initiate a premature withdrawal from an FD, they will end
          up forfeiting a portion of their interest earnings from the scheme.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Limited or no tax benefits &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Unless an
          individual specifically opts for tax-saving FDs, investors are not
          eligible for any tax exemptions or rebates on the fixed deposit
          interest earnings.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>
        <strong>What is Loan against FD?</strong>
      </h1>
      <p>
        Fixed deposit investors can avail of a loan against their fixed deposit
        investment. The maximum loan in such a case can vary between one bank FD
        and another. The loan quantum, in this case, is up to a certain
        percentage of the fixed deposit amount.
      </p>
      <p>
        The interest rate on such loans is generally lower when compared to
        unsecured credits. An investor availing such loans must mandatorily
        check interest rates on loan.
      </p>
      <p>
        The repayment tenure for the loan is limited to the maturity period of
        the fixed deposit in question.
      </p>
      <h1>
        <strong>Who Should Invest in Fixed Deposit?</strong>
      </h1>
      <p>
        Fixed deposits are perfect investment instruments for inexperienced
        investors. Further, risk-averse individuals can benefit greatly from
        such schemes. Since FDs offer assured returns, there is almost no risk
        of principal loss.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, investors should remember that the rate of return from such an
        investment is limited when compared to other high-risk options.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <strong>Taxation on FD Earnings</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Fixed deposit interest earnings in a year undergo{" "}
        <a href="https://groww.in/p/tds/">TDS</a>, or Tax Deducted at Source, as
        per the provisions mentioned in the Income Tax Act. Consequently,
        interest earnings are added during{" "}
        <a href="https://groww.in/p/income-tax-return/">Income Tax Returns</a>{" "}
        under the head &ldquo;Income from Other Sources&rdquo;.
      </p>
      <p>
        The IT Department would thereby adjust the TDS against your total tax
        liability. However, interest income is only deducted when interest
        earnings from all sources exceed Rs. 40,000. If the amount is lower than
        Rs. 40,000, you need to submit Form 15G/H to declare it to such
        financial institutions. You can opt to submit{" "}
        <a href="https://groww.in/p/savings-schemes/form-15g/">Form 15G/H</a>{" "}
        even if your interest earnings are higher than Rs. 40,000. However, in
        that case, you need to clear all tax liabilities from your end.
      </p>
      <p>
        If an individual opts for a tax-saving FD, on the other hand, they can
        claim tax exemption of up to Rs. 1.5 Lakh in a financial year on the
        principal amount.
