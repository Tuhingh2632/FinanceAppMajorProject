      <h3>
        Who doesn’t want to grow their money safely and steadily? The fear of
        losing money in market-linked investments probably ranks among the
        biggest fears people have. While taking risks can be rewarding, not
        everyone has the same appetite for it. However, there are several ‘safer
        options’ that you can consider. If low risks and modest returns satisfy
        you, then government-backed investment options are ideal for you. Here
        are seven government investment options for you:
      </h3>

      <h2>Seven Government Investment Schem…</h2>

      <h2>FIXED DEPOSITS</h2>
      <p>
        If you want to reduce your risks to almost zero, you can easily opt for
        fixed deposits in a nationalized bank or post office. They offer various
        interest rates at different periods and you can invest any amount to get
        a fixed return upon maturity. It is the safest investment option which
        has been tried and tested regularly for ages now.
      </p>

      <h2>PUBLIC PROVIDENT FUND (PPF)</h2>
      <p>
        It is one of the most popular investment options for low-risk investors.
        In PPF, you can invest money ranging from Rs. 500 to 1.5 lakh in a
        financial year for a period of maximum 15 years. The Government of India
        fixes the interest rate of PPF every quarter. The most attractive
        feature of PPF is that your entire investment amount along with the
        interest earned and the maturity amount is totally tax-free.
      </p>
      <h2>GOVERNMENT SECURITIES (G-SECS)</h2>
      <p>
        These are issued by national governments to finance its borrowings. They
        are generally very reliable because they are risk-free and have high
        market ratings. The different types of government securities include
        treasury notes, capital indexed bonds, floating rate bonds etc.
      </p>
      <h2>SOVEREIGN GOLD BONDS (SGBS)</h2>
      <p>
        Gold has always been regarded as a safe option for ages. Instead of
        buying physical gold, you can purchase sovereign gold bonds issued by
        the government. Though returns from SGBs are market-linked, the
        government has fixed interest rate of 2.50% on investment.
      </p>
      <h2>NATIONAL SAVINGS CERTIFICATE (NSC)</h2>
      <p>
        As an Indian citizen, you can purchase a National Savings Certificate
        (NSC) from any post office for a minimum Rs.100. There is no maximum
        investment limit. It will offer you a fixed return and carries virtually
        no risk since it is backed by the Government of India.
      </p>
      <h2>NATIONAL PENSION SCHEME (NPS)</h2>
      <p>
        It is a scheme in which you can contribute towards your retirement. The
        money which you’ll invest in NPS is managed by pension fund managers
        registered with the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority of
        India (PFRDA) in various funds. Upon maturity, while 40% of the corpus
        is used to buy annuity, the rest 60% can be withdrawn as lump sum. The
        entire amount withdrawn as lump sum is tax-free.
      </p>
      <h2>POST OFFICE MONTHLY INCOME SCHEME (POMIS)</h2>
      <p>
        POMIS is a safe investment option offered by post offices, where you can
        invest a minimum amount of Rs.1, 500 and maximum Rs.4.5 lakh. The
        government fixes the interest rate that you can directly transfer into
        your savings account every month. You can opt from any of these schemes
        that best aligns with your needs.
