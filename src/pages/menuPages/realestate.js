      <h1>REAL ESTATE INVESTMET</h1>
      <p>
        A smart investment has the potential to change our lives, providing us
        sufficient funds to live our dreams. Today, most of us have an
        investment portfolio comprising of a number of investments, be it
        stocks, gold, bonds, government schemes, etc., but one of the most
        underrated or ignored investment in recent times remains to be real
        estate. Given the huge economic boom in most Indian cities, the average
        income has increased, providing us added incentives to invest for the
        future and real estate could be the ideal investment choice for you.

      <h1>Real Estate and Its Importance</h1>
      <p>
        Kingdoms have fought battles over land for centuries, leaving no stone
        unturned in order to win that priceless property. While kingdoms might
        not exist today, the truth remains that the demand for land hasn’t
        changed, with everyone vying for a share of what’s available. Given the
        fact that prime real estate never loses demand or value, investing in it
        can be a great move, offering returns far higher than traditional
        investment options. Owning a home is the dream of everyone, and
        fulfilling this dream can not only give you emotional satisfaction but
        also monetary joy. Given the shortage of land in cities across the
        country, purchasing even a small flat can offer you returns, either in
        the form of rental income or by selling it for a profit.

      <h1>Points to Consider Before Investing in Real Estate</h1>
      <p>
        It is possible for someone who has no prior real estate experience to
        get carried away by the lure of profits and invest in real estate which
        offers no returns. Real estate investment comes with certain risks and a
        beginner should keep the following points in mind before spending
        his/her hard earned money.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Stay Patient</strong> – Buying a property is a time
            consuming affair, with most genuine property transactions taking a
            few days to be complete. While a number of real estate firms offer
            to complete formalities overnight, the fact remains that exhibiting
            patience can help you land a good deal. Jumping the gun can see you
            pay more for the property, or purchase one which doesn’t live up to
            your expectations. Also, sellers can delay projects, which could see
            your investment not offering any returns for a certain period,
            checking your patience.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Research The Property</strong> – Doing your homework before
            you step out to look for a property is critical today. With a number
            of projects coming up, it can be confusing to choose the right real
            estate, for sellers are typically known for sweet talking buyers.
            The amenities on offer, the history of the construction company, the
            materials used, the area a property is located in can all play a
            role in determining the returns you get on your investment. Failing
            to research before buying could see you regret later, negating your
            investment.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Check The Papers</strong> – The papers of a property are
            perhaps the most important factor one should consider, for it is
            possible for someone who is not acquainted with the real estate
            industry to get scammed into buying a property with fake papers.
            Buying a property without clear titles can lead to long drawn court
            cases or litigations, which essentially nullify the investment. All
            property papers should be checked by legal experts to authenticate
            them, for failure to do this could see you purchasing a property
            which could be mired in controversy. A number of times people sell
            properties below market rate, which should alert you, for such
            properties could have litigations or internal issues with the owner.
          </p>
        </li>

          <p>
            <strong>Check Market Rates</strong> – Most local governments provide
            a guidance value to help investors know the rate of a property.
            Knowing the market rate can help you track local trends, ensuring
            that you don’t get scammed into paying a higher amount than what a
            property deserves. Researching market rates and working out
            developments could help you extrapolate the returns you could expect
            in the future.

          <p>
            <strong>Talk To Neighbours</strong> – Talking to the neighbours is a
            good idea which most of us tend to ignore. This can help you get a
            first-hand perspective of how things are in a locality, helping you
            narrow down any problems or areas which could dilute an investment.
            Talking to them can also help you know the current market rates and
            see how the area has developed and the scope for future development.
            Given the fact that neighbours aren’t salesmen trying to sell you
            the property, one can get a clear picture of the real estate they
            intend to buy.

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Calculate Your Finances</strong> – It is important to
            calculate the finances you have in order to ensure that you meet
            certain goals. While it is easy to get loans from banks, calculating
            the interest and other factors is crucial.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Remain Positive</strong> – It is important to stay positive
            while executing a real estate deal, for there are bound to be times
            when deals don’t fall into place. Remaining calm and composed while
            interacting with property sellers can help you get additional
            benefits.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Negotiate</strong> – Negotiations are a key aspect of the
            Indian real estate system, as everyone is looking for a deal which
            will make them richer. Knowing the art of negotiation can help you
            save a lot of money and get additional freebies like parking spaces,
            furniture, etc.{" "}
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Consider The Risk Factor</strong> – Real estate investments
            are typically safer than other investments, but that doesn’t mean
            they are totally risk free. Legal hurdles and property disputes are
            extremely common in India and one should ensure that the property
            they are interested in is clear and minus the hassles.{" "}
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Owning a property can be the smartest move given the changing dynamics
        of our times, and keeping these simple points in mind can point a
        beginner towards the right path to investing in real estate.
